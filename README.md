# Mental Health Toolkit for Social Media  
TEAM: Lewis Buttle, Matthew Jameison, Daisy Kennedy, Patrick Michaels.  
CLIENT: Zheng Fang (https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/people/u1752231/)

An open source guide resource, designed to help social media developers incorporate a range of features that would lessen the negative effect their platform may have on their userbase's mental health.  
A range of varying tools were researched, designed and implemented, using a broad array of technologies and ideas to solve fundamental problems with common social media features.  

It is accompanied with supporting documentation:  
- Toolbox Guide: The project deliverable, which instructs how to utilise each tool, and summarizes the justification for their efficacy.
- Specification Document: The original, early document which initiated this project.
- Final Report: The overarching report for the project's entire life cycle.
